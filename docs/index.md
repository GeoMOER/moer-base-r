A life without R is no longer imaginable for many people and those who do not know R often do not know what they are missing.

R as a free programming language is regarded as the standard language for data-oriented problems in the scientific area and is suitable for almost all questions due to its functional range and a large repertoire of additional packages.

Unfortunately, even today the unfounded opinion that R is difficult to learn still holds true which makes it unnecessarily difficult for many newcomers to enter the wonderful world of R. We would like to change this with this course.

Course contents are among other things:

* scientific theoretical basics,
* R environment and syntax,
* data and object types,
* data management,
* import and export of data,
* simple functions,
* high- and low-level plotting functions and their arguments and
* various statistical analysis methods.

The course is aimed at beginners (and those who want to become one) and mainly students of the biology department as the number of participants is limited to 30.



# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able to

* Understanding the basic properties of an object-oriented programming language,
* Understanding of the storage, organisation, scaling and distribution of digital data ("digital literacy"),
* Flexible usage of the learned skills in various contexts


# Course features

This course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.
Given the enormous body of literature and methods available for CRAN R and RStudio, it can only be an entry point for more sophisticated and project-specific techniques.

| 16 | Exam                         | Pass an exam to test yourself. |



# Deliverables

In the near future, the exam from unit 16 will serve as a kind of certificate and prerequisite for certain courses to ensure that everyone has the same base of information about R.

# Preparation and prerequisites

There are no preparation or prerequisites for this course. The course itself will be a preperation for other courses.
