> “The Four Horsemen whose Ride presages the end of the world are known to be Death, War, Famine, and Pestilence. But even less significant events have their own Horsemen. For example, the Four Horsemen of the Common Cold are Sniffles, Chesty, Nostril, and Lack of Tissues; the Four Horsemen whose appearance foreshadows any public holiday are Storm, Gales, Sleet, and Contra-flow.” — Terry Pratchett, Interesting Times: The Play

## How can phenomenons be measured?
There are four data measurement scales: *nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio*.  These are simply ways to sub-categorize different types of data.

The first characterization is whether the data is numerical or not. If you have got numerical data, you have got **quantitative data**.
If you do not have numbers, you have got **qualitative data** (non-numerical, or also called categorical or discrete data).

## Qualitative Data ("categorical")
Non-numerical data that is usually textual and descriptive, like "mostly satisfied", "brown eyes", "female", "yes/no", etc.

### Nominal Scale Data (named)
Nominal scales are used for labeling variables, without any quantitative value. Notice that all of these scales are mutually exclusive (no overlap) and none of them have any numerical significance.  A good way to remember all of this is that “nominal” sounds a lot like “name” and nominal scales are kind of like “names” or labels.

Sub-types:
* Nominal with order: like “cold, warm, hot, very hot”)
* Nominal without order: like “male/female/divers”
* Dichotomous: scale with only two categories (e.g. male/female, yes/no)

### Ordinal Scale Data (orderd)
With ordinal scales, the order of the values is what is important and significant, but the differences between each one is not known. For example, we know that a #4 is better than a #3 or #2, but we don’t know–and cannot quantify–how much better it is. Another example is the difference between “OK” and “Unhappy”. Is it the same as the difference between “Very Happy” and “Happy?”

Ordinal scales are typically measures of non-numeric concepts like satisfaction, happiness, discomfort, etc.

Let's move on to quantitative data ...
