*Making your first steps in R with simple arithmetic operations.*

## # Hashtag and Run!

R treats the hashtag character, **#**, in a special way. It will not compile anything that follows a *#* on a line. This makes hashtags very useful for adding comments and annotations to your code. You will be able to read the comments, but your computer will pass over them.

```r
# This is a comment. Comments are very helpful
# when you want to describe what's going on in your code.
# Use them often!

hello <- "Welcome to R"
```

To run a chunk, you can hit the "Run" arrow to the right in the first Window (red box), or put your cursor inside the chunk and then hit CTRL + ENTER (CMD + ENTER on a Mac).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/unit_images/u01/gui_rstudio_exp2.png" caption="Hit the Run-Button." %}

The output of the code will print below the chunk in the second Window (Console).

```r
hello <- "Welcome to R"
print(hello)
```
```r
## Welcome to R
```

## Creating scalar objects and simple arithmetic operations

The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, furthmore square roots, exponentiation and some other.

Examples of arithmetic operations in R
```r
1 + 2
[1] 3
```
```r
2 - 1
[1] 1
```
```r
2 * 3
[1] 6
```
```r
2 / 3
[1] 0,6666666666666667â€¬
```
```r
2 ^ 3
[1] 8
```

That [1] next to your result is a reminder that this line begins with the first value in your result. Some commands return more than one value, and their results may fill up multiple lines.

## Assigning values to objects
```r
# Assign values to objects
a <- 1+2 # addition/allocation
a
[1] 3
```

```r
# adding another object
b <- 2-1
b
[1] 1

a + b # apply operators to objects
[1] 4

c <- (a + b) * 2 # brackets
c
[1] 8
```
