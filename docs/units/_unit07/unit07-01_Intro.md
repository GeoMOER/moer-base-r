## More on this topic
The examples in this unit are specifically related to the assignment. To get a much broader idea on visualization, please refer to our online book on [Creating Publication Quality Graphics in R](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/data/mriliasmooc/lm_data/lm_1901/index.html) by our former group members Tim Appelhans and Florian Detsch which is also available at Marburg Open Educational Resources.
