### Difference between Dotplot and Scatterplot:
 A dot plot is just a bar chart that uses dots to represent individual quanta.

 So if you wanted to plot the number of pets per household, you might have 10 households with 0 pets, 20 with 1 pet, 12 with 2 pets, etc. Over zero, you'd draw 10 dots; over one, you'd draw 20 dots, etc.

 A scatter plot puts a point representing a single realization of a tuple of data. For example, if you measured people's height and weight, you could create a scatter plot where one axis represented height and one represented weight. Each point on a scatter plot represents one person.
